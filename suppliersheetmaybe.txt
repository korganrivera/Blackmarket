shop will come to supplier, and choose the best combo of items within its size and financial limits.
should i load this table into game at start?  will this table change during runtime?
if crafting is a thing, and a new item finds its way to the supplier, then yes.
should each shop have a file like this of its own?  should i include the items location in the game?
do items have other properties that I need to include?
