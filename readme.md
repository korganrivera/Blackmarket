# Blackmarket
Source for my text-based rpg with a dynamic economic model. Project in progress.

If you want to play what I have so far, you only need mapmaker.c, and the .txt files.  
gcc mapmaker.c
and put the .txt files in the same folder as your executable.  

All you can do so far is walk around the map.  The map has streets with names, neighbourhoods with names, shops with doors.  The shops don't work yet.  Still doing infrastructure.
